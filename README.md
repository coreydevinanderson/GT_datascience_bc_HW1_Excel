Excel Homework (for Georgia Tech Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp): Kickstart My Chart

C: Corey D Anderson

**The .xlsx file contains the Kickstart My Chart assignment.**

There are currently **nine sheets** in the file.

The main sheets for the homework assignment are:

1) Data: the raw data for the Kickstarter campaigns.

2) Pivot1: The solved pivot table and bar plot for the different categories and their state.

3) Pivot2: The solved pivot table and bar plot for the different subcategories and their state.

4) Pivot3: The solved pivot table and line chart showing the count of each state over each month of the year.

5) Bonus: The first bonus question, with count of each state binned by range of the campaign goal.

6) Bonus2: Summary statistics for successful and unnsuccesful campaigns.

7) Sheet for Bonus state: Copy of Data (1) with filter to aid in subseting for Bonus2


There are two extra sheets that I created to help understand the data better:

8) Extra insight: Here I looked at the probability of successful and failed campaigns, and their odds of success.

9) Extra insight2: Here I broke down the counts of campaigns per country.

**The MS Word file contains the answers to the posed questions.**
