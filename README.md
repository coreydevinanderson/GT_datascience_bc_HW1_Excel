The repository contains an analysis of Kickstarter data using advanced functionality in MS Excel.

----

There are currently **nine sheets** in the .xlsx file.

The main sheets for the homework assignment are:

1) Data: the raw data for the Kickstarter campaigns.

2) Pivot1: The solved pivot table and bar plot for the different categories and their state.

3) Pivot2: The solved pivot table and bar plot for the different subcategories and their state.

4) Pivot3: The solved pivot table and line chart showing the count of each state over each month of the year.

5) Count of each state binned by range of the campaign goal.

6) Summary statistics for successful and unnsuccesful campaigns.

7) Copy of Data (1) with filter to aid in subsetting summary statisitics for the campaigns.

----

There are two extra sheets that I created to help understand the data better:

8) Extra insight: Here I looked at the probability of successful and failed campaigns, and their odds of success.

9) Extra insight2: Here I broke down the counts of campaigns per country.

**The MS Word file contains a write up of the inferences.**
